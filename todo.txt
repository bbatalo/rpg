-define target as a class... -> limit possible targets and define them better						
-locked ability -> unlock with a talent																
-factor in node levels for effect modifiers somehow													
-add ability costs																					DONE



-isTargetable should be meaningful -> constraint	
-add modifier for ticks?																																							
-set up default values for all attributes where needed																
-node activation condition -> one for each activation level (other constraints may apply)
-add randomizers to modifiers

possible?
-allow multiple parent nodes (later)
-change abilities reference from contantment?
