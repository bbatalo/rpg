-change reference type between class and stat to containment														DONE
-set up default values for all attributes where needed																
-how to change the limit value of a stat? -> via ability or talent(preferable)										DONE
-node activation condition -> one for each activation level (other constraints may apply)							
-define target as a class... -> limit possible targets and define them better										
-add talent branch and move lower cardinality to 0 from 1 -> constraint on having talents or abilities				DONE
-branches contain NODES, but reference start nodes within those nodes												DONE
-locked ability -> unlock with a talent																				
-factor in node levels for effect modifiers somehow																	



-isTargetable should be meaningful -> constraint	
-add modifier for ticks?																																							

possible?
-allow multiple parent nodes (later)
-change abilities reference from contantment?
