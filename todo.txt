-change reference type between class and stat to containment
-set up default values for all attributes where needed
-isTargetable should be meaningful -> constraint
-how to change the limit value of a stat? -> via ability or talent(preferable)
-node activation condition -> one for each activation level (other constraints may apply)
-define target as a class... -> limit possible targets and define them better
-add talent branch and move lower cardinality to 0 from 1 -> implies a constraint on having talents or abilities
-locked ability -> unlock with a talent
-factor in node levels for effect modifiers somehow
-add modifier for ticks?

possible?
-allow multiple parent nodes (later)
-change abilities reference from contantment?
